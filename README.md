# Python

I got the contact info of four potential candidates including yourself from Lambton College for collaboration, of just two students, with my team on this AI/ML project. This project officially started from Oct 20, 2021 and was granted for 6 months. For this project, we are using Python and text mining, NLP, AL/ML skills and working mostly with JSON format files. Since we need just two students for this project to help us here, the following task was designed and then one interview will be conducted within next week for evaluation of the four candidates to find the right people for this collaboration. Meanwhile, this might be a very good practical experience of working with Canadian industry problems for two selected candidates and it might be helpful in your career growth. I would like to mention that some of Lambton College clients have hired many students who worked efficiently on their relevant projects under Lambton College grant. It might be the case for selected students working on this project too.

In case you are interested in collaboration with our team, it is kindly requested to complete the following task and submit your Python code and the output by 12PM on October 31, 2021. Your Python script is preferred to be written in a way that; we could run it with no error.

The task is to download the attached JSON format data which is a FAKE RESUME converted into a dictionary format data file.

Read the file in Python. Then, by making use of appropriate skills, check whether the skills

'Management', 'problem solving' and 'SQL'.

are available in this fake resume using the whole JSON format info. Your code should print Yes/No in front of each skill.

Your final output should be something like the following table

----------------------
Skills   |.  Yes or No
----------------------
Management |
----------------------
Problem Solving |
----------------------
SQL. |
